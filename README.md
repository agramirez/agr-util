#agr-utils
This is a set of utilities to help achieve common tasks in a nice and uniform manner.  This is similar to [underscore](http://underscore.org)...but with a bit more capabilities.

##Install
To install the app you can get the latest code from github or install it using npm.

###Install from github

You can get the latest version of the code base by using git to pull all the files from github.com.  The easiest way to do it is to clone the repo.  This will create a local folder with most of the required files.  After cloning the repo you will need to install dependcies using npm. 

```
git clone git@github.com:agramirez/agr-util.git
cd agr-util
npm install
```
